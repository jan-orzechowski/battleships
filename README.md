# Battleships

## About

A very simple Battleships game made as a test assignment during a recruiting process.

It's a standard console application written in C#.

Visual Studio version: **2022 (17.0.1)**

.NET version: **.NET 6.0**

## How to build

To build it, just download the files and open the .sln solution in Visual Studio, then run it.

There are some tests that run in the Debug build. They are not included in the executable in the Release version.

## Limitations

* Ship placement is done randomly for the player
* Currently, the enemy is very dumb. It just fires shoots randomly, which makes it very easy to win the game. There are more interesting options described in this article: [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-an-intelligent-battleship-agent-bf0064a4b319?gi=b876e2757b1e)
